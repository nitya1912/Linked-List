# Linked-List

# Code-18

# Title:
 C++ code to define a singly linked list and demonstrates basic operations on the list, such as creating nodes, inserting a new node at the beginning of the list, and displaying the list's contents. 

# Theory:
The code defines a singly linked list in C++. It consists of a Node class that represents individual nodes in the list, each containing an integer value and a pointer to the next node. The program initializes a global head pointer to manage the list.

# Algorithm:
**Algorithm includes**: 1)Define a Node class to represent individual nodes in the linked list, each with data and a pointer to the next node. 2)Initialize a global pointer head to manage the head of the linked list. 3)Create nodes (newNode1, newNode2, newNode3, and newNode4) with specific data values (10, 20, 30, and 40) and link them to form a linked list. 4)Display the contents of the linked list by iterating through it using the disp function. 5)Set the head pointer to newNode1. 6)Display the linked list again to show the list's contents. 7)Insert a new node with data 5 at the beginning of the list using the insertAtBeginning function. 8)Display the updated linked list to include the newly inserted node at the beginning.

# Explanation of Code:
1)Creation of nodes with data values (10, 20, 30, 40).
2)Linking these nodes to form a linked list.
3)Displaying the linked list.
4)Inserting a new node with data 5 at the beginning of the list.
5)Displaying the updated linked list.

# Code-19

# Title: 
 C++ code for implementing a singly linked list and performing various operations on it. 

# Theory:
The code creates a singly linked list of nodes, each containing an integer value. It demonstrates adding nodes at the beginning and end of the list and displays the list at various stages.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Define a Node class to represent linked list elements with data and a pointer to the next node. 2)Initialize a global head pointer as NULL to manage the head of the linked list. 3)Create nodes with data values (20, 30, 40, 50) and link them together to form a linked list.
4)Display the linked list contents using the disp function. 5)Set the head pointer to the first node. 6)Display the linked list again after inserting a new node with data 10 at the beginning using insertAtBeginning. 7)Insert a new node with data 60 at the end of the list using insertAtEnd. 8)Display the updated linked list after both insertions.

# Explanation of Code:
1)Creates a linked list with nodes containing data values (20, 30, 40, 50).
2)Displays the linked list's content.
3)Inserts a new node with data 10 at the beginning of the list.
4)Inserts a new node with data 60 at the end of the list.
5)Displays the linked list again after each insertion, showing the modified list.
